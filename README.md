### üöÄ Key Features

-   **High Accuracy:** The model achieves **95.4% accuracy** on the NTHU Driver Drowsiness Detection Dataset.
-   **Real-Time Performance:** Optimized to run at **18-22 FPS**, making it suitable for live in-vehicle deployment.
-   **Hybrid Deep Learning Model:** It uses a **MobileNetV2 CNN** for efficient spatial feature extraction from facial landmarks, combined with a **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** to analyze the temporal sequence of frames.
-   **Robustness:** Implements temporal smoothing across video frames to increase prediction stability and reduce false positives caused by quick glances or blinks.
